# Sustaining Balance: Innovative Data Approaches for Food Security and Environment 🌍🍽️

## Abstract
Our research, "Sustaining Balance: Innovative Data Approaches for Food Security and Environment," explores how global food security needs differ by region and how they will evolve over the coming decades. We analyze key dimensions of food security and their implications for environmental stewardship.
